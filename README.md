# Vhdl-code-for-digital-clock-design
This detailed description explains the different sections and components of the VHDL code:

Entity Declaration: The entity digital_clock is declared, which defines the input and output ports. The input clk is the clock signal, reset is the reset signal, and hours, minutes, and seconds are the output signals to display the time.

Architecture Description: The architecture Behavioral defines the behavior of the digital_clock module. Inside this architecture, various signals are declared to keep track of the hours, minutes, and seconds. These signals include sec_count, min_count, and hr_count, which are integer counters representing the seconds, minutes, and hours.

1 Hz Clock Generation: A process is defined that updates the time counters based on the input clock clk and the reset signal reset. If the reset signal is high, the time counters and the 1 Hz signal clk_1hz are reset to their initial values.

Time Counters Increment: Inside the rising-edge portion of the process triggered by clk, the time counters are incremented. When the seconds counter reaches 59, it is reset to 0, and the minutes counter is incremented. Similarly, when the minutes counter reaches 59, it is reset to 0, and the hours counter is incremented. When the hours counter reaches 23, it is reset to 0 to represent a 24-hour cycle.

1 Hz Signal Toggle: The clk_1hz signal is toggled using the not operator on each rising edge of the clock. This generates a 1 Hz signal that can be used for other purposes, such as driving external components.

Output Signal Assignment: The integer values of the time counters are converted to binary using the to_unsigned function and then assigned to the output signals hours, minutes, and seconds. The 'length attribute is used to ensure that the binary representations have the correct bit widths based on the output signal declarations.

Overall, this VHDL code implements a digital clock that keeps track of time and displays hours, minutes, and seconds on separate output signals. The code is designed to be easily adaptable for different clock frequencies and display formats.
